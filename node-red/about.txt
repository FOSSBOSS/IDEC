I've never made a pallette, Im just looking at some of the palletes in my ~/.node-red directory. 

https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/palette/
https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes
https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/

hm. I think prograing the PLCs using node-red would be dope,
but theres a learning curve here too. What I might do is write the API in C, 
Then  try to find a tool to make the library into nodes. 

I mean what is this anyway?

    package.json
    lower-case.js
    lower-case.html

ima create 3 files for 1 function? Bro, theres like 125 functions I could write... 
which is exactly why I havent wrote the API yet.
